# 03 — The Imperial Archives / 國史館與記憶

## Memory is Power

Long-term memory turns an agent from “chatty” to “stateful.”  
It also turns memory into a high-value target.

## A simple tiering model

- Working memory (context window)
- Curated facts (short, stable)
- Raw archives (sensitive, access-controlled)

## Metaphor

Memory = the imperial archives:

- useful for governing
- dangerous if looted
