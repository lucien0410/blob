# 04 — Morning Court Audits / 早朝與風險報告

## Why daily reports matter

A powerful agent must be governable.

Daily audit reports should include:

- What happened (tasks)
- How it happened (tools used)
- What might be risky (risk flags)
- What requires approval (queue)

## Metaphor

The daily report is the morning court briefing:

- troop movements
- near-open gates
- overpowered generals
- weak walls
